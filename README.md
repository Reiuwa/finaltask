# finaltask
design a system that automates a repetitive information task and produces a valuable outcome
# How it works?
1. As soon as a new email arrives, our system "catches" it.
2. The system "reads" the email and thinks about what it means. It decides what is best tag for it.
3. The system puts a label on the email or gives it a star if it's super important.

# How to use?
1. You turn the system on by clicking Execute button.
2. System will see any new/unlabeled emails and sort them.
